3) Deliver the message using the sendMail() method of your transporter
*/

// 1) npm install nodemailer
// 2) This imports the Nodemailer module so that you can use it in your app. Also, receive it in a constant variable called nodemailer.
const nodemailer=require("nodemailer");
// 3) Create a transporter(mailman)
const transporter=nodemailer.createTransport({
    // SMTP set up starts
    host: 'smtp.gmail.com', // SMTP server (for Gmail)
    port: 587,              
    secure: false, 
    // SMTP set up ends
    // Gmail to use to send the emails(Gmail/Yahoo/Outlook)
    service:'gmail',
    // From your which gmail account(Sender)
    auth:{
        user:'arshnoorkaur@gmail.com',
        pass:'Arshnoor' // Nodemailer will authenticate and log-in on our behalf
    }
});
// 4) Set Email Options
let mailOptions = {
    // Definition of the email
    from: 'arshnoorkaur@gmail.com',
    to: 'arshnoorkaur@gmail.com', // Comma separated list or array of email addresses
    subject: 'Hello from Nodemailer',
    text: 'This is a test email!',
    html: "<p>This is HTML version of the msg</p>"
};
// 5) Send the Email
// sendEmail() accepts 2 arguments:mailOptions, and a callback fx(It will run when the Email has been sent)
transporter.sendMail(mailOptions, function(error, info) {
    // Case 1: Error occurred
    if (error) {
      console.log(error);
    }
    // Case 2: Successfully sent
    // info is an object which is returned on successful attempt 
    // info.response is a success message that the email server returns which usually contains a status code, a human readable confirmation(OK), etc
    else {
      console.log('Email sent: ' + info.response);
    }
});

/* SMTP:
SMTP stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol.
Used to send emails from email clients to mail servers and between mail servers.
Components:
SMTP Server: The server that receives and processes emails. (Gmail, Yahoo, and Outlook offer SMTP servers.)
SMTP Client: The software or application that sends emails through the SMTP server.
How It Works:
The email client connects to an SMTP server when it sends an email.
The server authenticates the sender and forwards the email to the recipientâ€™s server.
If error occurs, the server tries again later.
